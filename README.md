# Game Development with Python

Welcome to my Game Development with Python Projects repository! This is a personal collection of various Python game development projects that I develop as I learn the language. The projects range from simple games to more complex game development tasks, reflecting my progress from a beginner to a more advanced Python programmer.

## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Nerijus, and I'm on a journey to learn Python. This repository is a collection of my projects, showcasing my progress and the skills I've acquired. I hope this can also serve as a resource for others who are learning Python and exploring game development.

## Highlighted Projects

### [Snake](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/Game_Development/tree/main/Snake)
- **Description:** This project is a Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The game provides a classic snake gameplay experience where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow in size while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. It features smooth movement, food generation, score tracking, and collision detection. The player can control the snake's direction using arrow keys. This project showcases game development skills using Python's Turtle graphics.
- **Skills Highlighted:** Game development, Turtle graphics, event handling, collision detection, game loop, object-oriented programming.

### [Turtle Crossing](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/Game_Development/tree/main/Turtle_Crossing)
- **Description:** This project is a Frogger-inspired game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The game challenges the player to guide a character across a busy road while avoiding oncoming traffic. The player controls the character using the up arrow key to move vertically. The game features car generation, movement, and collision detection. The player's goal is to safely navigate across the road without colliding with any cars. The game displays a scoreboard, which updates the level as the player successfully crosses the road and ends the game if the player collides with a car. This project showcases game development skills using Python's Turtle graphics.
- **Skills Highlighted:** Game development, Turtle graphics, event handling, collision detection, game loop, object-oriented programming.
